## Overview

  I like javascript and everything on web,  when my dev-senses kick in I build presumably awesome stuff. I stay close to community
  and try to keep pace with which the web is evolving. I also like to blog about what I learn or things which I f  interesting.
  I have working experience in Angular, javascript, .Net, SQL Server
